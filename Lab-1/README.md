## Subject: Bootstrap Introduction

## Objectives

- Get familiar with various HTML elements and understand how they should be used;
- Understand CSS selectors and specificity;
- Play with Twitter Bootstrap;

In this laboratory work, had to learn how to work with one of the most powerful front-end framework for web development, Bootstrap.It has a lot of useful components to create our website. Like: CSS, a grid sistem and others. In order to create our first laboratory task I have used this steps:

- Choose the main idea of web project
- I have searched in internet
- Used a template for understanding Bootstrap and other different components
- Thought about design
- Combined my ideas with template/ experimenting.

## Conclusion
In this laboratory work i have learned to do some stuff using bootstrap. It wasn't really interesting, but still familiarizing myself with some css styles proved to be quite useful. For example, i've reminded myself the structure of an html document including header, body and footer. I've used div tags to divide sections in the html document, so that it will look better.

If we talk about css, using containers and scrolls so that navigating from one section to another would be smooth.

In conclusion, using bootstrap is very useful when creating a new website. It has some advantages and disadvantages. One of the advantages is that it is easy to use, while the disadvantage is that if you don't do heavy customization, all the projects would look the same.
